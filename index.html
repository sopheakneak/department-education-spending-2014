        <h2>Design Explanation</h2>
        <p>I've decided to utilize an interactive bar chart as the visual encoding for the dataset. 
            It’s challenging to present the dataset I have in a visualization. I’ve chosen the report of 
            United States Department of Education spending in 2014. There are 39 programs that the Department of 
            Education support in over 59 states. The varied range of differing variable makes it even more challenging 
            to create a good visualization. I decided to filter the data set to give readers a more comprehensive
             pieces as well as providing readers a tool to slice the data into a smaller piece. A bar graph with 
             sorted values is a great way to visualize this dataset; it gives readers the most accurate 
             elementary perceptual task. In addition, the interactive and sorting features of the visualization 
             give readers an easier way to track which state or program has spent the budget in retrospective. 
             I’ve also decided to simply stick to one color in order to keep users sane when looking at the visualization.
              I believe a bar graph is arguably the best, because it helps reader compare between each state and program. 
              A grouped bar chart would have too variation of data points that would make it difficult to readers to concentrate. 
              A geo map would be a good alternative, although it is quite difficult to visualize the different programs and states 
              using color gradient. Ultimately, a sorted bar chart would be the most effective visual encoding for this multi-varied dataset. </p>
        <p>Readers have the ability to control and filter the dataset for comprehension purposes. Upon clicking on “View by All States,” users will get a high overview 
            of how much each state is spending on educational programs. Since it is sorted, users are able to easily distinguish the state that 
            spent the most. On the other hand, upon clicking on “View by All Department of Education Programs”, users can answer to questions 
            such as “Which program is being spent the most on?” or “What programs the government have not paid attention much to?” The hovering 
            capabilities allows readers an access to get raw data for viewing purposes. Last but not least, the State drop down menu allows readers to 
            further investigate the dataset and view how each state spend budget their spending. Hence, these interactive features has tremendously help 
            sin slicing and aggregate the data into a more comprehensive and user-friendly view. </p>
